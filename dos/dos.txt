- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack aims to disrupt the normal operation of a website, server, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of traffic. This surge in traffic prevents legitimate users from accessing the service.

Having a redundant, scalable system or employing the services of a DDOS Mitigator could be successful solutions.
